This is Radiolater, an FM radio with a digital delay. Or it will be someday. At the moment all it does is throw up some display and blink the activity led.

The code in this project is based around the following hardware:
- Raspberry Pi A+
- TM1638 display module from dealextreme (sku 81873, but other colors exist)
- TEA5767 module from dealextreme (sku 239086)
- ADCDAC module from abelectronics.co.uk

Other hardware:
- Sparkfun FTDI basic breakout, used with bootloader

The software is based on the Raspberry Pi port of FreeRTOS from https://github.com/jameswalmsley/RaspberryPi-FreeRTOS .

Thanks to dwelch67 for his collection of baremetal examples. I'm using his bootloader to get started here.

Other software:
- Yagarto cross-compiler
- MinGW to run Yagarto
- Tera Term for xmodem sends to bootloader

Next steps:
- Create initial tasks, one to handle display tasks (output characters to display, read buttons into buffer) and one to run the menu (send characters to a display buffer, handle button 'events')
- Start talking to ADC and DAC
- Figure out how to vary RTOS period (changing configTICK_RATE_HZ isn't enough)
